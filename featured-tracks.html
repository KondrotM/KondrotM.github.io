				<h2>Kero Kero Bonito - Civilisation I and II</h2>

Although it may be obvious by now, Kero Kero Bonito has quite a cultural weight.
Their song Flamingo is a viral hit, and they even have a single tied to Bugsnax - a launch title for the PS5.
In the past, KKB have managed to create fun, accessible songs all the while not being shallow: songs about trampolines and cameras discuss the ebb and flow of life, appreciating the small things and the importance of being yourself.
Their last full-length album, Time and Place, reflects similar messages of reflection and self-care while the band works to bring some noisy flourishes out from under their sleeves.
<br/>
<br/>

With their latest release, a series of two EPs, KKB have used their touring experience and begun to look past people as individuals, setting their sights on society and culture as a whole.
<br/>
<br/>

A standout track from the first EP, 'When the Fires Come' shows this shift well. Its relaxed rhythm and fittingly warm instrumental track help achieve their goal of trivialising individual feelings when compared to the unrelenting and brutal effects of forest fires and climate change. To me, it feels like London Calling reimagined for the current climate.
<br/>
<br/>

The second EP of the series was recorded during lockdown and acts as a capsule of a huge cultural shift - something which the band, being already set on describing civisilation, was able to channel in order to record some phenomenal tracks.
<br/>
<br/>

The Princess and the Clock, one of the group's best song to-date, sees the band rock with familiar sounds and a newfound sense of sophistication. A key aspect of the track is its narrative, which is more fantastical than any other KKB track.
The song reflects what so many people underwent in the past year, locking themselves up in their safe abodes while mentally doing their best to stay within the beautiful lands of escapism. Whether that is revisiting childhood TV shows, reading Tolkien, or killing the Ender Dragon, the song reminds us this escape is a natural and human reaction when being thrust into a very shaky situation we are powerless to change.
<br/>
<br/>

21/04/2020 is KKB grounding themselves again. They forego any grand timeless statement and instead paint a picture of the here and now; they downplay any fear and mania felt at this time and stick to the lockdown's impact on the small things in life, making the most of the real and mundane. Intrinsically, the song almost acts as a sedative to the outgoing socialite.
<br/>
<br/>

Vladimir Nabokov once said that poetry is positional, that you should try to express one's position in relation to the conscious universe. With Civilisation I, KKB felt the world's strain and released the EP almost as a message warning of impending danger. Although overshadowed by coronavirus, it's not like late-2019 was a time of sunshine and celebration: it was a pretty turbulent time which only feigns in comparison to what came later rather than what came before it.
With Civilisation II, KKB once again realised its position. The strain had buckled and they knew what was needed now was not an 'I told you so' mentality or anything to add more fuel on the fire. What was needed was reasurrance that although things are as bad as they seem, civilisation is a strong creature and everything will be okay in the end.
<br/>
<br/>

The EP ends with Well Rested, a groove of a track which tells us that what we've gone through is not the end but, as has always been the case, the start of something greater. The track is the only one from the EPs to be bilingual, a trait which I think KKB have toned down in order to get their message through more clearly. Here, it is used in great taste and sounds assertive and celebratory of human culture.
During such a turbulent time, Kero Kero Bonito soldier on to bring us the fun and uplifting treasure of modern pop.
